## About GraphQL

- GraphQL is a query language for APIs, and can be used to query data from a server. 
- It also allows clients to specify exactly what data they need. 
- GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in an API, and makes it easier to evolve APIs over time. 
- With GraphQL, you ask for the data you need from the service, and you get exactly what you want.
- The GraphQL request flow from the client side will be to make a request to our GraphQL endpoint by defining the query data or information structure of the data we're interested in. 
- Our GraphQL endpoint will interpret the query, and serve data from the database by returning the shape defined in the query. 
- This means you describe the data you want to expose via the API, clients ask for exactly what they want and get results in the shape requested.
